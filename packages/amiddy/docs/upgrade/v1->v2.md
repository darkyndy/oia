# Upgrade from v1 to v2
v2 added a breaking change for `proxy` configuration if you have any options there.

See bellow diff for wha needs to be change in your amiddy configuration: 
```diff
{
   ...
  "proxy": {
+   "options": {
      "changeOrigin": false,
      "ws": false
+   }
  }
  ...
}
```

Now proxy configuration allows more settings, see [proxy.md](../config/proxy.md)
